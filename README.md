# TopDownMC
## Now with ~1500~ 1250+ lines of code! I redid most of it
## Basically this is a topdown Minecraft ripoff.
### Version 0.04.01 - The Undo Update
#### Removed world saving and block ids. I would considder it a finished update.
##### TL;DR: Removed good features because there was a less messy way of doing them.

###### I still haven't udated the javascript version.
