# TopDownMC
## Now with 1000+ lines of code!
## Basically this is a topdown Minecraft ripoff.
### Version 0.02.01 - The Half Finished GUI update.
#### Adds a few new useless tiles and adds the word "play" to the play button. <br>Also adds an early test of a pathfinding orange block.

###### I still haven't udated the javascript version.
