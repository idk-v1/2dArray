# Cave-Thing
## Now with about 1500 lines of code! I redid most of it.
## Basically this is a topdown Minecraft ripoff.
#### Use WASD to move around. <br>Use Left click to destroy tiles and R
ight click for placing tiles. <br>Use Q to cycle placing modes<br>Use E to pause (for now, also there is no reason to pause)
### Version 0.05.00 - The GUI Update - Every part of the GUI can be customized!<br>Just edit the menu.mnu file

###### I still haven't udated the javascript version.
