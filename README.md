# Cave-Thing
## Using the v0.04 version is still recommended. Infinite terrain is not worth the lack of tile IDs.
## Now with about 1250+ lines of code! I cleaned most of it.
## Basically this is a topdown Minecraft ripoff.
#### Use WASD to move around. <br>Use Left click to destroy tiles and Right click for placing tiles. <br>Use Q to cycle placing modes<br>Use E to pause (for now (it will eventually be the inventory), also there is no reason to pause)
### Version 0.05.01 - Cleaned up code and made the menu screen scale properly - <br>Every part of the GUI can be customized!<br>Just edit the menu.mnu file
